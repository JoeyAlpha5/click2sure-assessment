# Click2Sure-assessment

This documentation provides a breakdown of the Click2Sure API backend banking application.  The application currently consists of 5 API endpoints. Some of the requirements from the project brief have been left out due time constraints, but I've highlighted these in the Future improvements section which goes over how one would go about implementing them.

Use the sections listed below to get started with running the application on your machine.
